# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Video Poker

Video Poker is single-player Poker where we try to optimise our score by getting the best possible hands. The gameplay is as follows.

1. The user starts with 100 points.
2. When they click the "Deal" button the computer deals a hand of 5 cards. The user can choose any number of their cards to replace with new, random cards.
3. After the user finishes replacing cards, the game assigns points based on the resulting hand.
